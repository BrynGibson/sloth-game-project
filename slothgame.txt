Be carefull however, as some options will have different outcomes to certain situations which will affect your story,
Try to explore as many options as you can to undercover the story of slothscape!

First room, spawn

As you are running from the poachers you notice a man hole.
You mannage to lift it open and drop in, just mannageing to close it off before the poachers catch up.
you slide down the ladder into a brigthly lit room
Your eyes slowly adjusts to the bright ceiling lights dangling in front of your eyes.
You notice that there is only one exit, througth a small sewer grate.

Second room, south

Once you squeeze your way througth the grate you stick your head out the other side.
Its hard to make out whats in the room but you hear a soft snooring, it almost sounds like purring.
Once your eyes start to adjust to the light your heart sinks as you notice a leopard sleeping on a pile of rubbish.
Something else catches your eye as your looking around, a key hanging off of a pipe right below to leopard.
The room opens up with two exits, one behind the leopard and another one that goes deeper into the sewer.

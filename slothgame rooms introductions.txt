spawn

As you are running from the poachers you notice a man hole.
You mannage to lift it open and drop in, just mannageing to close it off before the poachers catch up.
you slide down the ladder into a brigthly lit room
Your eyes slowly adjusts to the bright ceiling lights dangling in front of your eyes.
You notice that there is only one exit, througth a small sewer grate.

first room, south

Once you squeeze your way througth the grate you stick your head out the other side.
Its hard to make out whats in the room but you hear a soft snooring, it almost sounds like purring.
Once your eyes start to adjust to the light your heart sinks as you notice a leopard sleeping on a pile of rubbish.
Something else catches your eye as your looking around, a key hanging off of a pipe right below to leopard.
The room opens up with two exits, one behind the leopard and another one that goes deeper into the sewer.

1 - Attempt to sneak behind the Leopard and continue North.
you decide thats its best to try and sneek past the leopard and ignore the key, 
2 - Sneak around the Leopard and head East.
3 - Try to grab the key that is right above the sleeping Leopard.
4 - Head back South.

first option, south
second room, south

You walk into the room, catious because you were scared of another beast waiting in your path,
You peak into the room and see a floating apparition which you can make out as something simalar.
As you study it more you realise that it is a sloth, but not a living one... a ghost.
It turns around and looks at you with its deathly eyes.
It opens its mouth and with a deep voice says
"In order to continue on your journey, you must first compleate a riddle"
Dazed and confused you comply with the ghost as you realise there is no other way,
Unless you want to deal with the leopard.

It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,
Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.
It lies behind stars and under hills,
And empty holes it fills.
It comes out first and follows after,
Ends life, kills laughter.
What am I...



You creep through the door and notice something in the corner,
It almost sounds like its feasting on something.
The smell in the room is putrid, like something died a long time ago.
A squeaking noise is coming from the thing in the corner, like something hasn’t been oiled.
As you creep forward to get a closer look you step on an old bone,
C R A C K
You stumble back as you see the figure turn around and move towards the light coming from the control room
The squeaking getting louder and louder as it gets closer.
As the figure moves into the light you see what has been feasting...
A Large, Black, wild dog... but without any legs,
Instead it sits upon two sets of wheels.
You don’t have time to process this as its coming right towards you!
What do you do?


1: If they have banana peel; use
2: If they have knife; use
3: Dodge and run north
4: Dodge and run south

Option 1: You remember the banana peel that you have in your inventory,
Using your quick wits your throw the banana onto the floor as the dog rolls towards you
The banana peel strikes the front left wheel of the dog and throws it off balance
The dog flies past you at lightning speed as you watch it crash through the door to your west

Option 2: You remember the rusty knife that you have in your inventory,
Using your quick wits you throw the knife in front of one of the wheels.
The knife strikes the front left wheel of the dog and throws it off balance
The dog flies past you at lightning speed as you watch it crash through the door to your west

Option 3: You decide to make a run for the door ahead of you,
Its risky but the dog just barely manages to miss you as you dive out of the way.
You get up and run for the door before the dog can turn around.
Its locked
(code for it they have a key or not)
If key: You remember the key that you have in your inventory
You quickly get it out and open the door, and jump through it just in time.
The dog is too large to fit, but it charging at you scares you enough to fall backwards down a sewer drain
As you hit the ground you are propelled downhill along a slimy sewer


If no Key: You remember that there was a key by the leopard, that’s where it would go.
But now you are stuck, and with no way out you are left with the dog.
You turn around and see that it is charging you, there nothing that you can do now...
(dead)

Option 4: you run into the control room.
You slam the metal door behind you and push a filling cabinet down to block the door
After you catch your breath you decide to look around for anything that could be of use
(back to room 4 options)


Room 5; exit

As you are sliding down the sewer you start to see the light at the end getting brighter and brighter,
Your eyes are so used to the dimly lit sewers that it blinds you until you have to close your eyes and hope for the best.
T H U D
You hit the bottom of the slimy slide and catapult forwards until you hit something hard.
Instantly the smell of the sewers has gone, and is instead replaced by a familiar smell...
The smell of home...
You look up to see a large tree, surrounded by large green pastures as far as the eye can see.
A sense of calmness and relief flows through your body as you realise, you've done it...
You are now free...
(the end)

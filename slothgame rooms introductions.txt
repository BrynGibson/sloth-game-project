spawn

As you are running from the poachers you notice a man hole.
You mannage to lift it open and drop in, just mannageing to close it off before the poachers catch up.
you slide down the ladder into a brigthly lit room
Your eyes slowly adjusts to the bright ceiling lights dangling in front of your eyes.
You notice that there is only one exit, througth a small sewer grate.

first room, south

Once you squeeze your way througth the grate you stick your head out the other side.
Its hard to make out whats in the room but you hear a soft snooring, it almost sounds like purring.
Once your eyes start to adjust to the light your heart sinks as you notice a leopard sleeping on a pile of rubbish.
Something else catches your eye as your looking around, a key hanging off of a pipe right below to leopard.
The room opens up with two exits, one behind the leopard and another one that goes deeper into the sewer.

1 - Attempt to sneak behind the Leopard and continue North.
you decide thats its best to try and sneek past the leopard and ignore the key, 
2 - Sneak around the Leopard and head East.
3 - Try to grab the key that is right above the sleeping Leopard.
4 - Head back South.

first option, south
second room, south

You walk into the room, catious because you were scared of another beast waiting in your path,
You peak into the room and see a floating apparition which you can make out as something simalar.
As you study it more you realise that it is a sloth, but not a living one... a ghost.
It turns around and looks at you with its deathly eyes.
It opens its mouth and with a deep voice says
"In order to continue on your journey, you must first compleate a riddle"
Dazed and confused you comply with the ghost as you realise there is no other way,
Unless you want to deal with the leopard.

It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,
Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.
It lies behind stars and under hills,
And empty holes it fills.
It comes out first and follows after,
Ends life, kills laughter.
What am I...
